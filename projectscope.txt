Player Accounts & Progress
Players can optionally register or log in to save progress, track stats, and store badges during the event.
Silent login allows players to join and play instantly without registration. Progress and badges are temporarily stored only for the session and are lost upon refresh or browser close.
If a silent user wins a boss fight, they can claim badges during that session, but they must register to save them until the event ends.
Players can leave and re-enter an active boss fight and retain their team assignment and current HP.
Matchmaking
Players join a live boss fight session by scanning an event QR code.
Upon joining, players are directed to a boss preview page that displays:
A prompt to enter a nickname (required before entering the game)
Gameplay instructions
The all-time individual leaderboard, shown in the boss display area
The player’s name
The total number of players who have joined the session so far
The “Join Boss Fight” button that players must click to confirm they are ready to join the game. The button is grayed-out when the boss is still on cooldown and shows the message: “Boss is on cooldown. Time remaining: [MM:SS]”
Once at least 2 players (1 per	 team) have clicked the “Join Boss Fight button”, the battle starts instantly.
Players are automatically assigned to teams when the battle starts.
There are two teams by default (the host can increase the number of teams).
Team selection and switching are not allowed.
Once a nickname is submitted, they cannot be changed unless the player leaves the session and rejoins using the event QR code.
Boss Mechanics
On the first creation, the boss spawns immediately, regardless of whether players have joined.
The boss’s maximum HP scales dynamically with players joining the fight.
However, to maintain a meaningful challenge, the boss will always have a minimum HP threshold (e.g., requiring at least 30 correct answers total), which may be adjusted during testing to ensure gameplay balance and fairness.
All teams attack the same boss (shared boss model). Total damage dealt is tracked per team, and the team that contributes the most damage wins the fight.
After the boss is defeated, it enters a cooldown state with time remaining (duration assigned by host) before the next fight can start. If new players join while the boss is on cooldown, they are directed to the boss preview page with countdown timer to inform players when the next boss fight will be available.
The game runs indefinitely until the host ends it or admin ends the event.
Question Mechanics
Questions are drawn randomly from a data bank based on the selected boss category.
Each question includes 8 answer choices, with exactly 1 correct answer and has a default time limit of 30 sec that can also be altered by hosts and admin.
During gameplay, only 4 answer choices will be shown to the player. These 4 are randomly selected from the original 8, ensuring the correct answer is always included.
The position of the correct answer among the 4 shown choices is randomized for every player to avoid predictability.
If all questions within a boss category are used before the boss is defeated, the system will loop through existing questions. However, to maintain fairness and variety:
The order of questions will be reshuffled for each player and each loop cycle.
The answer choice arrangement will also be reshuffled per player and per loop, ensuring a unique experience and preventing memorization of patterns.
The question selection and answer arrangement are handled independently per player session, maintaining a consistent level of challenge across different players.
MCQ-Driven Combat
Each attack is initiated by answering a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with four answer options.
Correct answers deal damage to the boss based on response speed:
Fast response: 1.5 damage
Normal pace: 1.0 damage
Slow response: 0.5 damage
Incorrect answers or failure to answer within the time limit result in the player losing 1 heart.
Players start with 3 hearts. Reaching 0 enters a knocked-out state and cannot continue attacking unless revived by a teammate.
K.O. & Revival
The knocked-out player is shown a unique revival code (generated by the system) on their screen along with a countdown timer (e.g., 60 seconds).
To revive a teammate:
A Revive button appears on each surviving teammate's screen.
Clicking the button opens a code input field.
One of the surviving players enters the revival code from their knocked-out teammate’s screen.
If the code is entered correctly within the time limit, the knocked-out player is fully revived with 3 hearts and can resume the fight.
Failure to revive before the timer expires erases that knocked-out player’s progress for the current boss.
Leaderboard
During an ongoing boss fight, players can toggle the leaderboard as a popup overlay, allowing them to view rankings without exiting the game.
Players can also hide the leaderboard at any time to return to normal gameplay without interruption.
During each boss fight, a live leaderboard is displayed:
Team rankings with real-time total damage dealt to the boss
Player rankings with their name and real-time total damage contribution (for hosts and admins)
Updated dynamically as players answer questions
At the end of each boss fight, a summary leaderboard is shown:
Team Leaderboard: Final team rankings based on total damage dealt
Individual Leaderboard: Top players ranked by damage contribution during the current fight
All-Time Individual Leaderboard: Overall top players ranked by cumulative damage dealt across all boss fights during the event
Reward Badges
All Badges are obtainable during the event.
All badges are event-based rewards and can only be earned during active boss fights
All badges are static and predefined.
Milestone badges can be earned during the gameplay and will be retained even if the player leaves the current boss fight. Progress toward these badges is continuously tracked across all boss sessions within the same event.
Types of Badges:  
Boss Defeated Badge: Awarded to every player on the team that deals the highest total damage to the boss during the fight.
Last-Hit Badge: Awarded to the player who lands the final blow that defeats the boss.
MVP Badge: Awarded to the individual player with the highest total damage dealt during the fight, regardless of team outcome.
Answer Milestone Badge: Awarded to the player who reaches these milestones:
10 Questions answered correctly
25 Questions answered correctly
50 Questions answered correctly
100 Questions answered correctly
Hero Badge: Awarded to the player who defeats every boss in the current event.
During the event, earned badges are stored temporarily in each player's Badge section for viewing and tracking.
All badges are cleared once the event ends.
Question Bank
Question Management:
Hosts can create, view, edit, and delete their own questions in the shared data bank. 
Each question must include exactly 8 answer choices, 1 correct answer, and a time limit (default: 30 seconds, customizable). 
Questions are organized by category, and hosts can view metadata such as author, time limit, and usage count.
Admins have full access to manage all questions.
All questions are stored in a shared global question pool.
Access Control:
Hosts can manage (create/edit/delete) only their own questions
Admins can view and manage all questions across all hosts.
Validation Rules:
All questions must pass validation to ensure no duplicate answers, exactly one correct answer, non-empty choices, and a valid numeric time limit.
Database Design:
The Question Bank consists of three related tables: one for storing question metadata, one for storing associated answer choices, and one for managing question categories. This normalized structure ensures flexibility, consistency, and clear validation for use in the game.
Question Table with attribute: id, category_id, question_text, author_id, created_at, updated_at
Answer Choice Table with attribute: answer_choices with attribute: id, question_id, choice_text, is_correct, order_index
Category Table with attribute: id, name, description (optional).
